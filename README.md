Anaconda turns your Sublime Text 3 into a full featured Python IDE. Read the plugin documentation on [http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda](http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda).


## Getting Started
Anaconda works out of the box but there are multitude of options and features that you can tune and adapt to your own style or needs.

## Tooltips
anaconda officially supports user themeable tooltips and displaying advanced signatures. This is how it looks in a dark theme:

**Note**: This feature is enabled for users of Sublime Text 3 build 3070 or superior only.

## Troubleshooting
This section lists some common issues faced by users, along with workarounds.

#### Anaconda does not appear in the Available Packages list on Package Control.

**Work-around**: You have to update your Package Control version to the version 2.0 or better.

#### Errors in the console about "the file can't be open" in worker.py file.
Your Sublime Text can't find the interpreter that you set in your configuration, by default, anaconda sets this as `python` so it will get your configured Python interpreter in your PATH (if any).

**Work-around**: Add a Python interpreter (named `python`) to your PATH or set a right full path to your python interpreter as parameter of `python_interpreter` settings option, for example `/usr/local/bin/python3.4`.

#### Auto-complete for import behaves badly.
Sublime Text 3's default Python package cancels the auto-completion when some words are detected (for example `def` or `class`). This list of words includes `import`.

**Work-around**: Create a new Python directory in your Packages directory and copy the contents of the file [Completion Rules.tmPreferences][Completion-Rules] there with the same name.
Delete your Sublime Text Cache file `Cache/Python/Completion Rules.tmPreferences.cache`.

**NOTE**: The cache path can be optained from the Sublime TExt 3 console using the code `sublime.cache_path()`

#### Auto-complete drop-down shows up incorrectly.
SublimeCodeIntel interferes with anaconda's auto-completion.

**Work-around**: Consider disabling SublimeCodeIntel for Python views or disabling/removing it completely when using anaconda.

### Available plugins for Anaconda
Anaconda is a plugable architecture platform itself, it means that anaconda can be extended to offer rich IDE like features to other languages, I created other extensions that brings
anaconda capabilities to other languages, the complete list of them can be shown below

| Language | Web Site | Package Control | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Go** | https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda_go | No | Discontinued, you should be using GoSublime |
| **Rust** | https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda_rust | Yes | Active |
| **PHP** | https://github.com/DamnWidget/anaconda_php | Yes | Active |

Would you like to see your language empowered by anaconda? Use `anaconda_rust` or `anaconda_php` as templates and bring your language to life with anaconda's plugable architecture.
